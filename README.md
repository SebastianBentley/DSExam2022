# Stage 1: Business
The idea of this project, is to develop a model, to predict heart disease given medical datasets.
We will try to predict heart disease, given data on another/other diseases.


*Hypotheses:*
- High BMI, smoking etc. cause a higher risk of heart disease.
- Heart disease can be prevented, by having good mental health.

**What is in the focus of your interest?**\
Our focus lies on heart failure prediction.

**Why is it interesting?**\
If we could predict wheter a person is likely to develop heart disease, we could inform that person, before it happens.

**Which outcome do we expect from your research?**\
We expect to find parameters, which is most likely to cause heart disease.

**Who may be a user of the results?**
- Hospitals could use this, to quickly analyze wether a person is at risk.
- Every person, that does not already know, about their risk of heart disease.

# Stage 2: Data
- We have three different datasets so we each took one and cleaned and prepared for modeling\
**The 3 python notebooks are**
- Data1
- Data2
- Data3

# Stage 3: Artificial intelligence
- We have three different datasets so we each took one prepared a model for each file.\
**The 3 python notebooks are**
- Data1
- Data2
- Data3

The models can be found in the **deploy** folder.


# Stage 4: Visualization
- We've created a small webservice that takes user input, that fits to all of our models respectively.
- To run the website open **website.ipynb** and run with Jupyter Notebook.
- Open a browser and enter url **localhost:5000** to access prediction service.
- Visualization of the data can be found after inputting data and pressing "submit"-button and after that pressing "visualization"-button.
