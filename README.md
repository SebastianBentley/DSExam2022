# Stage 1: Business
The idea of this project, is to develop a model, to predict heart disease given medical datasets.
We will try to predict heart disease, given data on another/other diseases.


*Hypotheses:*
- High BMI, smoking etc. cause a higher risk of heart disease.
- Heart disease can be prevented, by having good mental health.

**What is in the focus of your interest?**\
Our focus lies on heart failure prediction.

**Why is it interesting?**\
If we could predict wheter a person is likely to develop heart disease, we could inform that person, before it happens.

**Which outcome do we expect from your research?**\
We expect to find parameters, which is most likely to cause heart disease.

**Who may be a user of the results?**
- Hospitals could use this, to quickly analyze wether a person is at risk.
- Every person, that does not already know, about their risk of heart disease.

# Stage 2: Data
- We have three different datasets so we each took one and cleaned and prepared for modeling\
**The 3 python notebooks are**
- Data1
- Data2
- Data3

# Stage 3: Artificial intelligence
- We have three different datasets so we each took one prepared a model for each file.\
**The 3 python notebooks are**
- Data1
- Data2
- Data3

The models can be found in the **deploy** folder.


# Stage 4: Visualization
- We've created a small webservice that takes user input, that fits to all of our models respectively.
- To run the website open **website.ipynb** and run with Jupyter Notebook.
- Open a browser and enter url **localhost:5000** to access prediction service.
- Visualization of the data can be found after inputting data and pressing "submit"-button and after that pressing "visualization"-button.

**Visualization Techniques**
We have used several graphs, both 2D and 3D, to visualize our data, in simple to more complicated ways.
We created images to show relationships and patterns of data, that otherwise would not be clear.
For our business case, a doctor could use these graphs to indicate to a patient, were they lie on a spectrum, to show their target goal to prevent heart disease.
The best way to see these graphs and descriptions, is trough by running the website on **localhost:5000** and clicking the `-- Visualization --` button.
They can also be found in the different *Data1, Data2* and *Data3* notebooks.
