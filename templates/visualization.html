          <h5>From dataset 1</h5>

              <p style="font-size: 10px; color: black;">On this graph we plotted the age groups up against the cases of heart disease. In this case we seem to have clear peaks and valleys in the distribution. Based on our data these seem to be higher number of cases in the age groups 20-30 and 70-80 with a lesser chance in the age group 60-70. This age data might be easier for a doctor to show to patients since age is something that they can relate to.</p>

          <div class="col-6">
            <a href="../static/data1_heartrate.jpg" target="_blank">
              <img src="../static/data1_heartrate.jpg" alt="gg" width="700" />
              <p style="font-size: 10px; color: black;">On this graph we have the maximum heart rate reached by patients compared to the heart disease cases. This is one of the fields from our data that has a high correlation to the target value, and the graph seems to show a trend. The graph seem to indicate that the higher a patients maximum heart rate was recorded to be, the higher chance of heart disease that patient might be at risk of, peaking in the value range of 170-190 bpm.</p>             
            </a>

              <img src="../static/data1_gender.jpg" alt="gg" width="700" />
              <p style="font-size: 10px; color: black;">This graph shows the gender distribution among the heart disease cases. This graph shows that a majority of the patients that contracted a heart disease were female. Again this distribution might is relatable to a patient therefore this graph might be good to show and use to inform the patient.</p>

              <p style="font-size: 10px; color: black;">This line graph is simple, but very descriptive. As expected, it shows that a person is more likely to have heartdisease, when they get older. With this data, we see an exponentional rise in the average of people having heart disease. A doctor could on this graph, give an indication to a patient, on the risk given their age.</p>

              <img src="../static/BMIAgeHeart.png" alt="gg" width="600" />
              <p style="font-size: 10px; color: black;">This 3D graph showing how BMI and Age have an effect on heart diseases. By looking at the graph in 3D, we can analyse the numbers better, by grouping the data in those who have heart disease, and those who does not. We can se the general density in BMI with Age, and how it might affect the result. In this graph, we can see that most people with a higher BMI at a young age, does not have heart disease, which is surprising. A doctor could use this, to compare a patients BMI and Age with the density of other data. For instance, if a patient is young, but has a higher BMI, they could consult them on a target BMI, to lower risk of heart disease.</p>
